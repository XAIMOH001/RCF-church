    <div class="about-section">
      <p>
        Since its founding on <strong>20th September 2020</strong>, Risen Christ Fellowship has been steadily growing —
        numerically, spiritually, structurally, and more. We shall continue to grow until we become what God wants us to become.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our joy is to be <strong>compassionate</strong>, <strong>inclusive</strong>, and to walk with Jesus. Through <em>gospel, service,
        worship, and missions</em>, we bring God closer to our hearts and to those around us.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a fellowship of believers, we have the honor of proclaiming the glory of Christ to one another in a loving and caring setting.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are a place of <strong>prayer, deliverance, peace, and joy</strong> to all who join us. Our community is richly diverse, with
        people of different ages and backgrounds coming together to worship and serve. We welcome all individuals seeking God’s love —
        our doors are open to every soul welcoming Jesus into their heart.
