        <div class="about-section">
            <p>
                Since its founding on <strong>20th September 2020</strong>, Risen Christ Fellowship has been steadily
                growing —
                numerically, spiritually, structurally, and more. We shall continue to grow until we become what God
                wants us to become.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our joy is to be <strong>compassionate</strong>, <strong>inclusive</strong>, and to walk with Jesus.
                Through <em>gospel, service,
                    worship, and missions</em>, we bring God closer to our hearts and to those around us.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a fellowship of believers, we have the honor of proclaiming the glory of Christ to one another in a
                loving and caring setting.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are a place of <strong>prayer, deliverance, peace, and joy</strong> to all who join us. Our community
                is richly diverse, with
                people of different ages and backgrounds coming together to worship and serve. We welcome all
                individuals seeking God’s love —
                our doors are open to every soul welcoming Jesus into their heart.
            </p>
